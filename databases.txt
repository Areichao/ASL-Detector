MediaPipe Hands: This is a Google tool that detects hand landmarks in real-time. It doesnâ€™t recognize signs directly but provides hand positions that can be fed into a classifier for letter/word detection.
TensorFlow/Keras Models: Look for models trained on common datasets like the ASL Alphabet Dataset or Sign Language MNIST, which recognize letters and some basic gestures.
Hugging Face Models: Hugging Face hosts various pre-trained models, some of which may include sign language recognition for letters or simple words.
